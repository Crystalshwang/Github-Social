# Github-Social-Network
This is the final project for ECE227 Big Data Network. We want to explore the Github Social Network(https://snap.stanford.edu/data/github-social.html).

By analyzing the node degree and clustering coefficient, we can show some properties of this network. We also analyze the communities in this network, and find the relationship betwee nthis communities. Futhermore, we compare different methods of link prediction.
